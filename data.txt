{"title":"Health inequality in adolescence. Does stratification occur by familial social background, family affluence, or personal social position?","abstract":"Background\nTwo new sets of stratification indicators – family's material affluence and adolescent's personal social position- were compared with traditional indicators of familial social position based on parental occupation and education for their ability to detect health inequality among adolescents.\nMethods\nSurvey data were collected in the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Survey in 2003 from nationally representative samples of 12-, 14- and 16-year-old Finns (number of respondents 5394, response rate 71%). Indicators of the familial social position were father's socio-economic status, parents' education, parents' labour market position. Indicators of material affluence were number of cars, vacation travels, and computers in the family, own room and amount of weekly spending money. Adolescent's personal social position was measured as school performance. Measures of health were long-standing illness, overweight, use of mental health services, poor self-rated health and number of weekly health complaints. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was applied to study the associations between stratification indicators and health variables.\nResults\nAll three groups of indicators of social stratification showed inequality in health, but the strongest associations were observed with the adolescent's personal social position. Health inequality was only partly identifiable by the traditional indicators of familial social position. The direction of the inequality was as expected when using the traditional indicators or personal social position: adolescents from higher social positions were healthier than those from lower positions. The indicators of family's material affluence showed mainly weak or no association with health and some of the indicators were inversely associated, although weakly.\nConclusion\nIn addition to traditional indicators describing the socio-structural influences on the distribution of health among adolescents, indicators of family's material affluence should be further developed. Adolescents' personal social position should be included in the studies of health inequalities.","authors":[{"surname":"LK","given_names":"Koivusilta"},{"surname":"AH","given_names":"Rimpelä"},{"surname":"SM","given_names":"Kautiainen"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"BMC Public Health","issn":""},"year":"2006","volume":"6","issue":"","fpage":"110","lpage":"110"},"pmid":"16643660"}
{"title":"Subaortic and mid-ventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with an apical Aneurysm: a case report","abstract":"Background\nMost patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have asymmetric septal hypertrophy and among them, 25% present dynamic subaortic obstruction. Apical HCM is unusual and mid-ventricular HCM is the most infrequent presentation, but both variants may be associated to an apical aneurysm. An even more rare presentation is the coexistece mid-ventricular and apical HCM. This case is a combination of obstructive HCM with mid-ventricular HCM and an apical aneurysm, which to date, has not been reported in the literature.\nCase presentation\nThe patient is a 49 year-old lady who presents a combination of septal asymmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and midventricular HCM, a subaortic gradient of 65 mm Hg and a midventricular gradient of 20 mm Hg, plus an apical aneurysm. Her clinical presentation was an acute myocardial infarction in June 2005. One month after hospital discharge, the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a right bundle branch block (RBBB) with no Q waves or ST segment elevation. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries, left ventricular hypertrophy and an apical aneurysm.\nConclusion\nThis case is a rare example of an asymptomatic patient with subaortic and mid-ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, who presents a myocardial infarction and normal coronary arteries, and during the course of her disease develops an apical aneurysm.","authors":[{"surname":"Cianciulli","given_names":"Tomás Francisco"},{"surname":"Saccheri","given_names":"María Cristina"},{"surname":"Konopka","given_names":"Isabel Victoria"},{"surname":"Serans","given_names":"Dora Faustina"},{"surname":"Acunzo","given_names":"Rafael Salvador"},{"surname":"Escudero","given_names":"Alejandro Mario García"},{"surname":"Masoli","given_names":"Osvaldo Horacio"},{"surname":"Prezioso","given_names":"Horacio Alberto"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Cardiovascular Ultrasound","issn":""},"year":"2006","volume":"4","issue":"","fpage":"15","lpage":"15"},"pmid":"16553961"}
{"title":"Commentary on effects of anthropogenic and natural organic chemicals on development, swimming behavior, and reproduction of Daphnia, a key member of aquatic ecosystems.","abstract":"Because of their trophodynamic role, small invertebrates are often critical components of ecosystems. An especially important group of freshwater invertebrates is the water fleas of the genus Daphnia. These animals are often the dominant herbivores in lakes and ponds. They play a key role in determining water clarity (by grazing on algae) and they are an important part of the diet of fish. Natural chemical signals (kairomones) produced by predators affect the development, life history strategy, and behavior of zooplankton. Laboratory studies of anthropogenic chemicals that have biological activity (xenobiotics), such as the insecticide carbaryl, have demonstrated effects of concentrations in the 1 to 5 ppb range on Daphnia development, growth rate, and swimming behavior in our laboratory experiments. Low concentrations of carbaryl inhibit growth and reproduction and delay maturation, whereas survivorship was not effected. These sublethal exposures to carbaryl reduced Daphnia population growth rate (productivity) by about 15% (at 5 ppb), enough to have significant ecological effects on the rest of the lake community. The insecticide carbaryl showed synergistic interactions with natural chemicals associated with predators (kairomones) that modify Daphnia development and life history characteristic. In addition, there were complex synergisms between carbaryl, the predator odors, and oxygen concentration (low oxygen concentration can be either a natural environmental stress or an anthropogenic stress). Daphnia produce males facultatively, usually in late fall; at other times, reproduction is asexual.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","authors":[{"surname":"Dodson","given_names":"S I"},{"surname":"Hanazato","given_names":"T"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","issn":""},"year":"1995","volume":"103","issue":"Suppl 4","fpage":"7","lpage":"11"},"pmid":"7556027"}

{"title":"A test of the model that RNA polymerase III transcription is regulated by selective induction of the 110 kDa subunit of TFIIIC","abstract":"TFIIIC is a RNA polymerase (pol) III-specific DNA-binding factor that is required for transcription of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes. Active human TFIIIC consists of five subunits. However, an inactive form has also been isolated that lacks one of the five subunits, called TFIIIC110. A model was proposed in which pol III transcription might be regulated by the specific induction of TFIIIC110, allowing formation of active TFIIIC from the inactive form. We have tested this model by transient transfection of HeLa and HEK293 cells with a vector expressing TFIIIC110. We have also made stably transfected HeLa cell lines that carry a doxycycline-inducible version of the cDNA for TFIIIC110. We show that the induced TFIIIC110 enters the nucleus, binds other TFIIIC subunits and is recruited to tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in vivo. However, little or no effect is seen on the expression of pol III transcripts. The data argue against the model that pol III transcription can be effectively modulated through the specific induction of TFIIIC110.","authors":[{"surname":"Innes","given_names":"Fiona"},{"surname":"Ramsbottom","given_names":"Ben"},{"surname":"White","given_names":"Robert J."}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Nucleic Acids Research","issn":""},"year":"2006","volume":"34","issue":"11","fpage":"3399","lpage":"3407"},"pmid":"16822860"}
{"title":"The DNA polymerase λ is required for the repair of non-compatible DNA double strand breaks by NHEJ in mammalian cells","abstract":"DNA polymerase lambda (polλ) is a recently identified DNA polymerase whose cellular function remains elusive. Here we show, that polλ participates at the molecular level in a chromosomal context, in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in mammalian cells. The expression of a catalytically inactive form of polλ (polλDN) decreases the frequency of NHEJ events in response to I-Sce-I-induced DSB whereas inactivated forms of its homologues polβ and polμ do not. Only events requiring DNA end processing before ligation are affected; this defect is associated with large deletions arising in the vicinity of the induced DSB. Furthermore, polλDN-expressing cells exhibit increased sensitization and genomic instability in response to ionizing radiation similar to that of NHEJ-defective cells. Our data support a requirement for polλ in repairing a subset of DSB in genomic DNA, thereby contributing to the maintenance of genetic stability mediated by the NHEJ pathway.","authors":[{"surname":"Capp","given_names":"Jean-Pascal"},{"surname":"Boudsocq","given_names":"François"},{"surname":"Bertrand","given_names":"Pascale"},{"surname":"Laroche-Clary","given_names":"Audrey"},{"surname":"Pourquier","given_names":"Philippe"},{"surname":"Lopez","given_names":"Bernard S."},{"surname":"Cazaux","given_names":"Christophe"},{"surname":"Hoffmann","given_names":"Jean-Sébastien"},{"surname":"Canitrot","given_names":"Yvan"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Nucleic Acids Research","issn":""},"year":"2006","volume":"34","issue":"10","fpage":"2998","lpage":"3007"},"pmid":"16738138"}
{"title":"Review of new evidence regarding the relationship of gasoline exposure to kidney cancer and leukemia.","abstract":"Four new or updated epidemiologic studies were presented at a meeting on the health effects of gasoline exposure held in Miami, Florida, November 5-8, 1991. A focus of these studies was whether there is a relationship between gasoline exposure and kidney cancer and leukemia. For gasoline distribution workers, who have a relatively high exposure, there was some evidence for a kidney cancer relationship in three studies but none in the fourth. There was evidence for an acute myelocytic leukemia relationship in three studies. The fourth study dealt only with kidney cancer. It is possible that the benzene content of gasoline was responsible for the leukemia findings. It is uncertain whether gasoline exposure is a cause of kidney cancer.","authors":[{"surname":"Enterline","given_names":"P E"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","issn":""},"year":"1993","volume":"101","issue":"Suppl 6","fpage":"101","lpage":"103"},"pmid":"8020432"}
{"title":"Defining the role of pollutants in the disruption of reproduction in wildlife.","abstract":"Although chemical exposure has been associated with reduced reproduction in certain North American fish, reptiles, and mammals, definitive cause-and-effect data are lacking in many instances. Because the increasing use and global transport of industrial chemicals pose significant risk to successful reproduction, methods should be developed that can define the geographic extent and magnitude of injury and risk to wildlife. Because industrial chemicals are articles of commerce, information about injury to wildlife has been contentious and too often ineffective in changing societal behavior. The following strategies are advocated for inferring causal relationships. First, a balanced and comprehensive assessment of the data is necessary to determine the geographic extent of exposure and reproductive effects associated with environmental pollution. Initial efforts to document reproductive injury should focus on specific ecosystems in which detrimental effects have been observed, but lack sufficient causal data. Model systems (including experimental mesocosms or field ecosystems) should be identified or designed that can adequately test multigenerational reproductive effects. Mechanistic data from supportive laboratory studies on reproductive toxicity, quantitative structure-activity relationships, and bioaccumulation can be used to predict effects of related pollutants and to determine risk. Such information is essential to prevent future injury to wildlife and to prioritize the numerous remediation decisions facing our society.","authors":[{"surname":"Hose","given_names":"J E"},{"surname":"Guillette","given_names":"L J"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","issn":""},"year":"1995","volume":"103","issue":"Suppl 4","fpage":"87","lpage":"91"},"pmid":"7556030"}

{"title":"Identification of frequent cytogenetic aberrations in hepatocellular carcinoma using gene-expression microarray data","abstract":"Background\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities that occur in HCC suggest that tumor-modifying genes (oncogenes or tumor suppressors) may be driving selection for amplification or deletion of these particular genetic regions. In many cases, however, the gene(s) that drive the selection are unknown. Although techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have traditionally been used to identify cytogenetic aberrations, it might also be possible to identify them indirectly from gene-expression studies. A technique we have called comparative genomic microarray analysis (CGMA) predicts regions of cytogenetic change by searching for regional gene-expression biases. CGMA was applied to HCC gene-expression profiles to identify regions of frequent cytogenetic change and to identify genes whose expression is misregulated within these regions.\nResults\nUsing CGMA, 104 HCC gene-expression microarray profiles were analyzed. CGMA identified 13 regions of frequent cytogenetic change in the HCC samples. Ten of these regions have been detected in previous CGH studies (+lq, -4q, +6p, -8p, +8q, -13q, -16q, -17p, +17q, +20q). CGMA identified three additional regions that have not been previously identified by CGH (+5q, +12q, +19p). Genes located in regions of frequent cytogenetic change were examined for changed expression in the HCC samples.\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that CGMA predictions using gene-expression microarray datasets are a practical alternative to CGH profiling. In addition, CGMA might be useful for identifying candidate genes within cytogenetically abnormal regions.","authors":[{"surname":"Crawley","given_names":"Joseph J"},{"surname":"Furge","given_names":"Kyle A"}],"biblio":{"journal":{"title":"Genome Biology","issn":""},"year":"2002","volume":"3","issue":"12","fpage":"research0075.1","lpage":"research0075.8"},"pmid":"12537564"}
